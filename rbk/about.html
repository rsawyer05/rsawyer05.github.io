        <div class="ron-p">
          <p>Ron, owner of Refurbished Office Panels, founded Recycle Bikes for
            Kids 8 years ago. Ron saw a need in the local community for a
            program that provided bikes to kids for free and Recycle Bikes for
            Kids was born.  Over 8 years later through Ron's determination and
            being well known in his community Recycle Bikes for Kids gives away
            close to 2,000 bikes a year.</p>

          <p>Joe coordinates the day to day
            operations of Recycle Bikes for Kids and is involved in every aspect
            of all the bikes and their brief stay at the shop just before
            they're handed off to an excited child.  Joe makes sure all the
            volunteers have all the tools and supplies they require to fix the
            endless need for bikes flowing out the door.  The rest of the week
            Joe is gathering bikes, and coordinating fund raising efforts for
            the nonprofit. Joe has a vast knowledge of bicycle repair and is
            well connected in the community.</p>
