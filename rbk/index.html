          <p>Recycle Bikes for Kids is a non-profit organization dedicated to
            providing one free bike to any kid and to offer adults the
            opportunity to earn a bike by volunteering.</p>

          <h2 class="what-we-do">What We Do:</h2>
          <p>In our nearly eight years of operation we have given away over
            10,000 bikes.  We are able to operate by the generous donations from
            the local community of kids and adult bicycles and bike parts.
            We provide one free bike to any kid sixteen years or younger that
            is in need of a bike. Kids older than sixteen or adults wanting a
            bike may volunteer a set amount of work hours helping us with shop
            duties or fixing kids bikes. After completing the hour requirements
            they can pick out a bike for themselves and we will teach them how
            to repair it free of charge.</p>

          <h2 class="welcome">Welcome!</h2>
          <p>Here at Recycle Bikes For Kids we are dedicated to helping the
            comunity get active by riding bicycles. That includes kids that have
            never ridden before to adults who want to get into cycling, to
            someone who wants a bike as transpertation to get around town.
            Through the Recycle Bikes experience we hope to contribute to your
            knowledge of bicycle repair and build an appreciation by getting
            your hands dirty fixing the next childs bike.</p>
